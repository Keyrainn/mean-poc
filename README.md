**Important**

Using tool called the "Angular CLI" to create  Angular project.

With the latest version, this tool will ask you two questions:

1) Do you want to use the Angular Router?

2) Which CSS pre-processor do you want to use?

Simply hit ENTER twice and confirm the default (without entering any value).

The defaults (which we will use therefore) are:

1) No (No router for now, we'll add it later)

2) CSS
